# Data-Preprocessing
The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. In this chapter, we will discuss the essential data preprocessing techniques that will help us build good machine learning models.
The topics that we will cover are as follows:
Removing and imputing missing values from the dataset
Getting categorical data into shape for machine learning algorithms
Selecting relevant features for the model construction
